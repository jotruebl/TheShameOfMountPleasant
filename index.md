***Update 10/12/2024 1:14pm PDT:** There has been some confusion regarding the landlord's stated
reason for the eviction. The reason for this is because of imprecise language
used by the landlord at various times. In the official eviction notice, the landlord stated
landlord use for "a person owning voting shares in the family corporation."
However, in the evidence submitted to the dispute resolution hearing and in
his statements to [Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/10808686/bc-woman-evicted-declining-voluntary-rent-increase/), the landlord has said the unit was needed for
his brother (who is a sharehold).*

***Update 10/12/2024 1:00pm PDT:** The original article stated the tenant's husband was in hospice at the time of the
rent increase request. The article has been corrected to show that the tenant's
husband was a couple weeks away from undergoing medical assistance in dying
(MAID).*

**Mount Pleasant, Vancouver** — A 26-year resident of Mount Pleasant was
recently forced out of her long-time home under circumstances that have left
many in the community outraged. The landlord, who has publicly been called a
"steward" of the community,
allegedly harassed and pressured the elderly tenant after she refused a
voluntary rent increase, ultimately forcing her to
leave in what members of the community are calling "an absolute disgrace."

## A Tenant’s Ordeal

For over two decades, the tenant, a woman in her 70s, lived in her unit without
any significant issues. The problems began in 2019, when the landlord requested a
voluntary rent increase far above the legal limit. Living on a fixed income and
recently bereaved, the tenant refused the $445 increase. Following this refusal,
she claims the landlord embarked on a campaign of harassment designed to push
her out of her home.

## The Full Story

For over 26 years, the tenant lived in her Mount Pleasant home, enjoying
stability and a strong sense of community. In 2019, the landlord asked all
tenants in the building to voluntarily accept a $445 rent increase—an amount
well above the legal limit but technically allowed since it required tenant
approval. The tenant, whose now-late husband was preparing to undergo medical
assistance in dying (MAID) time of the request, declined the
increase due to her fixed income and the emotional and financial strain of her
loss.

### A Deteriorating Situation
After her refusal to pay the voluntary rent increase, the tenant claims that her once-secure living situation began
to deteriorate. According to her, the landlord and his family initiated a
campaign of intimidation and harassment that started with subtle hints and
escalated to face-to-face verbal harassment, invasion of privacy via unwelcome
entry to her apartment, and threats
of eviction.

    <em>- Landlord's daughter and family employee to the tenant (Allegedly)</em>
</p>

Presented below are the photos, text messages, entries from the
tenant's personal journal, and eyewitness statements all submitted as evidence
for the dispute resolution hearing. A tenant's statement document that was
submitted as part of the evidence for the hearing alleges it is proof of a systematic
effort to pressure her into leaving.

One of the alleged tactics involved occasionally placing newspaper clippings
with bold headlines about rising rents on a desk just outside the tenant's door,
with highlighted sections emphasizing the gap between her rent and current
market rates. The first newspaper clipping appeared shortly after the tenant's
refusal to voluntarily increase her rent. The article's subtitle read
"Two-bedroom apartments near $3,000 a month", closely echoing a section in the
landlord's request for rent increase, which read "The average rent for
a one-bedroom apartment is now $1,828.00 while the average rent for a
two-bedroom is $2,916.00."

The tenant alleges the newspaper postings were part of a tactic to pressure her into accepting a higher rent or else move out to
allow the landlord to collect the higher rent he believes he is owed. The landlord did not deny posting the clippings in the evidence they submitted
for the dispute resolution hearing, stating "As the owner of the building I can display
any legal document I choose in the public areas the same way I display the
annual business licence."

The message was clear: she was paying too little, and her continued residence
was unwelcome.

### Verbal Harassment and Intimidation Tactics

As time went on and it became clear that newspaper clippings would not be
sufficient to coerce the tenant into leaving, the landlord and his family
allegedly began verbally harassing the tenant. Entries in the tenant's personal
journal document multiple instances of
verbal harassment by the landlord and his daughter who is an employee of the
family business. These incidents were recorded at
the time they occurred, and screenshots of the journal entries were
submitted as evidence in the dispute resolution hearing and are presented below.

    <em>- Tenant's testimony</em>
</p>


In one encounter, the daughter reportedly told the tenant, "I will do
anything to protect my family." Another journal entry from March of 2021 recounts how the
daughter expressed her displeasure over the
tenant's refusal to pay the voluntary rent increase. The entry states
"Then she approached me and said something like when they asked
people for a voluntary rent increase, everybody did except for [REDACTED] and
me. (Are they treating [REDACTED] badly?)" 

By 2024, the encounters had begun to
wear on the elderly widowed tenant. An entry from January 3, 2024 states she was confronted by the
daughter in the laundry room who called her a "c**t" and said "Nobody wants you
here. "The entry ends with the tenant writing to herself "[I] Have to go-leave the place. Make
the change."

The landlord did not address these allegations in his submitted evidence.

### An Escalation in Tactics

As time passed, the alleged harassment escalated. The tenant recounts one particularly distressing incident involving the landlord's brother, who is also an associate in the family business. During a small dinner party with friends, the landlord's brother allegedly entered her unit without permission. The tenant’s testimony, submitted as evidence in the dispute resolution hearing, details the incident:

> “I was having a small dinner party with [two friends] at my house, playing
Christmas music. We were laughing and having a good time. Suddenly, [the
landlord’s brother] opens my back door and says to me, ‘Tone it down, [tenant].’
He came right into the kitchen. I was sitting at my dining room table. Simply
opened the door, entered, and said this. Then he was about to leave, turned
around and said, ‘If you don’t tone it down, I’ll ask you to leave.’”

This incident, where the landlord's brother allegedly entered her home uninvited and issued threats, left the tenant feeling deeply unsettled and intimidated.

The tenant also provided written testimony about the frequent threats of
eviction she received from the landlord, documented in phone screenshots, which
she claims were used to intimidate and harass her. The landlord did not address
these either of these allegations in his evidence.

### Neighbours Begin to Notice

The situation reached a point where even neighbors began to notice. The tenant's
upstairs neighbor submitted a signed testimony describing how, on separate
occasions, the landlord and his brother expressed disdain for the tenant. The
statement recounts how on October 31, 2022 the landlord's brother allegedly remarked,
"We like you guys, but please just be aware it's an old wooden building and the
noise travels easily. I mean, I don’t care about the tenant downstairs—she can
roll around in the grave for all I care—but we don't want to disturb [the other
neighbor]." On June 22, 2024, the brother reportedly stated, "I don't give a shit about
her." 

The landlord did not dispute the June 22nd quote in the submitted evidence
but denied the October 31 remark, however incorrectly stating that the witness
claimed it took place at the same time as the June 22nd instance, raising
question as to the validity of this denial.

On June 30, 2024, one week after being quoted as saying "I don't give a shit about her", the
landlord and his brother served the tenant with an eviction notice. The landlord claimed that the unit was
needed for a family member—a rationale that the tenant and her supporters immediately
questioned.

### The Dispute Resolution Hearing

On July 16, 2024, the tenant formally disputed the eviction notice, arguing that
it was issued in bad faith, motivated by a desire to obtain higher rent for the
unit that had been rent controlled for 26 years. According to the Residential Tenancy Act (RTA) in British Columbia,
landlords may end a tenancy to house a family member, but it must be done in
“good faith.” 

In the case of Gichuru v Palmar Properties Ltd., 2011 BCSC 827, the BC Supreme Court determined that good faith requires an honest intention without any dishonest motive, irrespective of whether the dishonest motive was the primary reason for ending the tenancy. As outlined in GL2A-1:

“[Good faith] means they do not intend to defraud or deceive the tenant,
 they do not have an ulterior purpose for ending the tenancy, and they are not trying to avoid obligations under the RTA or the tenancy agreement.”  (GL2A-1) 

“If there are comparable vacant rental units in the property that the landlord
could occupy, this may suggest the landlord is not acting in good faith.”
(GL2A-1)

According to Residential Policy Guideline 2A, the 'good faith' requirement imposes a two part
test. First, the landlord must truly intend to use the premises for the purposes
stated on the notice to end the tenancy. Second, the landlord must not have a
dishonest or ulterior motive as the primary motive for seeking to have the
tenant vacate the residential premises. For example, the landlord may intend to
occupy the unit. **That intention may, however, be
motivated by dishonest or undisclosed purposes.**

Given the seemingly overwhelming amount of evidence the tenant had compiled
throughout the years, it appeared likely she would win the dispute. However, the legal framework offered little
reassurance. The hearing was set for September 10, just 10 days after the
eviction notice was to take effect. If she lost, she faced immediate
homelessness with no clear timeline for vacating. If she secured another
apartment in the meantime, she risked having to pay double rent—a financial
burden she could not afford.

</p>

Facing these overwhelming challenges, the tenant withdrew the 
dispute on August 30, 2024. 

On the same day that the tenant withdrew her dispute, the
landlord listed another unit in the same complex on Craigslist. This raised
further doubts about the landlord’s stated need to house a family member and
suggested a calculated effort to replace a long-term tenant with someone who
could pay more.

### Call to Action

This experience is not unique. In Vancouver’s competitive rental market,
long-term tenants, particularly seniors, face increasing pressure as landlords
seek to maximize profits by replacing them with tenants who can pay higher
rents. This case raises serious concerns about housing insecurity for vulnerable
populations in the city.

The Mount Pleasant community must demand accountability from landlords who exploit their tenants. Residents are urged to contact local officials and advocate for stronger tenant protections, ensuring that no one else has to endure what this tenant has experienced.
