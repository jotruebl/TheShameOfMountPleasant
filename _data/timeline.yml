    In 2019 the landlord sends a letter to all tenants asking them to
    **voluntarily** accept a $445 rent increase. As the request was described as
    voluntary, it was considered legal despite being significantly above the
    legal limit. Living on a fixed income and having just been bereaved that
    same month, the tenant refused the $445 increase.

     The landlord and his family allegedly begin subjecting the tenant to verbal
     abuse, invasion of privacy and unlawful entry to her unit, refusal to repair utilities, and illegitimate
     threats of eviction. [A complete description of each event along with its
     associated evidence can be found below.](/#the-full-story)

    Less than two weeks after threatening to evict the tenant if she did not
    "watch her mouth" and one week after stating "I don't give a shit about her"
    to the tenant's upstairs neighbour, the landlord serves the tenant with an
    eviction notice, claiming the unit was needed for a close family member to
    occupy.

    The tenant files for dispute resolution, claiming the eviction is in bad
    faith. Under British Columbia’s Residential Tenancy Act (RTA), a landlord
    may end a tenancy to house a close family member, but this must be done in
    “good faith” and free from ulterior motives.

    Faced with the dilemma of either risking immediate homelessness if she lost
    the September 10 hearing or incurring unaffordable double rent if she
    secured housing before the decision, the tenant withdraws her application for
    dispute resolution.

    of her tenancy, the landlord lists a different single bedroom unit in the same complex
    for rent on Craigslist.
