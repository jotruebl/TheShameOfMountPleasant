title: The Disgrace of Mount Pleasant 
subtitle: How a Long-Term Tenant Was Forced Out by a Landlord Previously Heralded as a "Community Steward"
---



**Mount Pleasant, Vancouver** — Roselyn Wagner, a 26-year resident of 140 W 10th Ave, Unit 1, has been forced out of her home by a landlord who presents himself as a “steward of the community.” The reality is far darker: this so-called steward harassed and pressured an elderly tenant until she had no choice but to leave, all in pursuit of higher rent.

### A Pattern of Harassment and Abuse

For years, Wagner was subjected to relentless harassment from her landlord, John Davis. In 2019, Davis requested an exorbitant rent increase—$445 above the legal limit—knowing full well that Wagner, a retiree on a fixed income, could not afford it. When she refused, the harassment escalated. Davis posted newspaper clippings outside her door highlighting the rising rent prices in Vancouver, a clear attempt to intimidate her into moving out.

The verbal abuse from Davis and his family became a regular occurrence. Wagner was called derogatory names, threatened with eviction for illegitimate reasons, and even had family members enter her home without permission, violating her privacy and safety.

### Forced Out by Legal Loopholes

When Wagner finally received an eviction notice in June 2024, claiming that the unit was needed for a family member, she decided to fight back. But the current law offered her little protection. The hearing was scheduled for September 10, a mere 10 days after the eviction notice was set to take effect. If she had lost, there was no law to dictate how long she would have before being forced to vacate, leaving her in an impossible position.

Wagner was forced to secure alternative housing in case she lost the dispute—a process that took significant time and effort. She had to pay a month’s rent upfront to hold the new place, fearing it would be taken by someone else. The prospect of paying double rent if she won the dispute added another layer of stress, making the fight seem increasingly futile.

### The Landlord’s True Colors

The final insult came on the very day Wagner withdrew her dispute. Davis, the self-proclaimed “community steward,” posted a listing on Craigslist for another unit he owns. This unit, which could have easily housed the family member cited in the eviction notice, was left vacant while Wagner was pushed out of her home. It’s clear that Davis’s actions were not about family needs but about greed and a blatant disregard for the well-being of his tenants.

### A Community Disgrace

This is not just an eviction—this is the disgrace of Mount Pleasant. A landlord who publicly claims to care for the community has shown his true face by abusing and displacing a vulnerable tenant who had called this neighborhood home for nearly three decades. Wagner’s story is a chilling reminder of the power landlords can wield and the devastating impact it can have on the lives of long-term residents.

### What Can Be Done?

As a community, we must not stand by while those who claim to be stewards of our neighborhood exploit their power to harm those who are most vulnerable. It’s time to hold these so-called community leaders accountable for their actions.

### Call to Action:
- **Spread the Word:** Share Wagner’s story with your neighbors. Let them know about the injustice that has taken place in our community.
- **Demand Accountability:** Hold landlords like John Davis accountable. Don’t let them hide behind a façade of community service while they abuse their tenants.
- **Support Tenant Rights:** Advocate for stronger legal protections to prevent such injustices from happening again.

The Mount Pleasant community deserves better than landlords who prey on long-term residents for profit. Let’s ensure that this disgrace does not go unnoticed or unchallenged.
